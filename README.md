## About

Arc is an in-development game engine written in C++, allowing an ECS approach and C# scripting (In Active Development).

I develop it in my spare time as a personal project, so expect frequent periods of time with no activity in this repository.

## Set up

You can clone Arc Game Engine using git. Make sure you do a ```--recursive``` clone!

```git clone --recursive https://github.com/MohitSethi99/ArcEngine.git```

Arc Game Engine is built in a Windows environment, using Visual Studio 2019. 

Execute the script `scripts/Win-GenProjects.bat` 
to generate the solution and project files.

## Current Features

Right now, Arc Game Engine is very bare-bones. Its most remarkable features are:

| Feature | Description | Status |
| ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| **Scene system** | Scene-based entity management. Scene serialization with YAML. | Done‚úîÔ∏è |
| **ECS support** | Entity Component System approach through *entt*. | Done‚úîÔ∏è |
| **2D Physics** | Basic 2D Physics using Box2D | Done‚úîÔ∏è |
| **2D Renderer** | 2D batch renderer supporting OpenGL. | Done‚úîÔ∏è |
| **3D Renderer** | Basic 3D renderer with lighting, IBL and PBR workflow (not fully supported PBR for now) supporting OpenGL. Shadows are not supported for now. | Done‚úîÔ∏è |
| **ImGui support** | Basic game editor and in-game debug UI using ImGui. | Done‚úîÔ∏è |

## Planned Features

| Feature | Description | Status |
| ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| **Shadow Support** | Basic scripting in C# using mono. | WIP üíª |
| **Shadow Support** | Soft and Hard shadow support in OpenGL 3D Renderer. | WIP üíª |
| **Asset manager** | Basic asset handling API. | WIP üíª |
| **3D Physics system** | Nvidia's Physx engine support for 3D physics. | TODO üìã |
| **Audio system** | Sound API. | TODO üìã |
| **Font support** | Extend the Renderer capabilities so it can draw text. | TODO üìã |
| **Direct3D and Vulkan support** | Extend the Renderer to support D3D and Vulkan. | TODO üìã |

The game editor is in continuous development.
